        My main concern is passing this class and another class i have this
        year. i want to do well and really understand the things that i am
        learning.

    <u><strong>Five Elements</strong></u
    >:
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>
        I used the Heading 1-3 elements, color element, underline element,
        emphasis element and the list element
      </li>
    </ul>
    <u><strong>Enhancements</strong></u
    >:
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>
        I changed the heading elements all to h2, underlined the emphasized "Red
        Door Grill", added a bullet point to all answers under the questions,
        changed the color on my name to my favorite color, emphasized all of my
        headings, and bolded the words "five Elements" and "Enhancements".

    <ul type="circle">
      <li>
        What I learned in this assignment was how to make text bigger and
        bolder, color elements, and how to make things into a list. What I would
        like to learn is how to put images and links onto a webpage.
